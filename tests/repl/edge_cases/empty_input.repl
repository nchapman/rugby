#@ session: empty_input
#@ description: Test empty and whitespace-only input handling

# Note: empty input should be a no-op in the REPL
# These tests verify the REPL doesn't crash on edge cases

# Simple expression after thinking about empty input
>>> 42
=> 42

# Whitespace in expressions
>>> 2 +   3
=> 5

>>> [1,   2,   3]
=> [1 2 3]

# Expression with leading/trailing spaces
>>> x = 10
=> 10

>>> x
=> 10
