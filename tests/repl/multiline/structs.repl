# Simple struct
>>> struct Vector2D
...   x: Float
...   y: Float
... end
=> (defined)

>>> v = Vector2D{x: 3.0, y: 4.0}
=> main.Vector2D{X:3, Y:4}

>>> v.x
=> 3

>>> v.y
=> 4

# Struct with different types
>>> struct Person
...   name: String
...   age: Int
... end
=> (defined)

>>> p = Person{name: "Alice", age: 30}
=> main.Person{Name:"Alice", Age:30}
