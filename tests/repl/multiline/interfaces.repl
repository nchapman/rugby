# Simple interface
>>> interface Describable
...   def describe: String
... end
=> (defined)

# Interface with multiple methods
>>> interface Shape
...   def area: Float
...   def perimeter: Float
... end
=> (defined)

# Interface can be used with structs that have methods
# (Classes have field type inference issues in REPL)
